Topic: Brain tumor detection and segmentation

Abstract: 
"Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation from MRI Images using CNN and U-Net Models"
The CNN model is used to detect whether a tumor is present or not. After 15 epochs of training, the accuracy calculated was 99.6%.
The U-Net model is used to segment tumors in MRI images of the brain. After 10 epochs of training, the accuracy calculated was 98%.
These deep neural networks are implemented using the Keras functional API. The trained models can be used to detect and segment tumors on brain MRI images, resulting in a satisfactory outcome.

You can download the U-net trained model from: [Unet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qt7l3HOGIwOguWsMKc5fuwG2NGiGOucf?usp=sharing) and CNN trained model from: [CNN](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fXFzMwNG6HrbNp6-GASAgeybeSB3JWCd?usp=sharing)
