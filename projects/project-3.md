Topic: Brain tumor detection

Abstract: Brain tumor detection from brain MRI images using CNN and image segmentation using U-net. These deep neural networks are implemented with Keras functional API. The CNN model is trained for 15 epochs. After 15 epochs, the calculated accuracy is about 0.996. The U-net model is trained for 10 epochs. After 10 epochs, the calculated accuracy is about 0.98.

Use the trained models to do detection and segmentation on brain MRI images. The result is satisfactory.
