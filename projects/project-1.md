Topic: Recognizing Blurred Documents (RBD)

Abstract: The model is an autoencoder convolutional network created using Keras and the TensorFlow library in Python. One of its unique features is its ability to recognize images of varying sizes. It does this by first converting the images into 64x64 segments, then recognizing each segment, and finally connecting them to form the final image.
