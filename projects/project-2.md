Topic: Sudoku solver (SolSudo)

Abstract: SolSudo is a deep learning based sudoku solver. It solves sudokus using images with an intelligent method. The model predicts the missing digits and fills them in one by one as each level is completed. The process repeats until there are no more missing digits. SolSudo can detect sudoku from an image using tesseract-ocr, but this can cause problems. To avoid this, I created a method where the numbers are entered one by one, with 0 representing a blank.
